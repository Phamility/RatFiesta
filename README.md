Personally, I think this mod is directed towards those new to mods, as it doesn't add too much content, nor too little. Also I REALLY eyeballed all the stats I added to the game, so something may be broken .-. Speaking of broken - no clue how this mod works in multiplayer so... goodluck!

Probably my first and last mod, it was an experience, Ima just some of my code here just incase of, idk..

You can use anything you want here, idrc, if you haven't already, I recommend joining the Tmodloader discord server, I ctrl+F'd a decent chunk of my code from over there.

Shoutout to Mirsario, his Armor helper helped me make the 15 vanity and 2 armor sets, I tried but gave up spriting the long way and oh lordy. THANK YOU Mirsario!

4/22/22 Note: I'm probably never going to return to this again, I'm not even gonna bother adapting it to 1.4 and the data I used to make this mod is on an old computer. Anyways, thanks for playing!

||CODE||

I posted my code for the slightly unique coded items and thoughts here, so if you wanted to know how smt worked, go for it.

||ART||

I used pixilart.com/draw# so uh lol...I don't use art programs / nor do I know how to do art properly, so if you're new I'd recommend that I guess. Remember to set your brush to 2 pixel. I typically shaded with 2 pixels but sometimes I used 1 pixel shading when I didn't have space - Oh yea and about that, I don't know JACK about shading lol, the crappy rule of top right bright, and bottom left dark, is what i followed lol. Most of my sprites were 32 x 32.
