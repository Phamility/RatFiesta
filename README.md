Welcome to the Rat Fiesta..!

Just a small-medium mod to add some spice made by Phamility

Features:
- 55 New Accessories
- 7 New Weapons
- 13 New Summons
- 1 New Boss
- 1 New Armor Set
- 5 Mysterious Idols
- 3 Keystones
- 7 Vanilla Reworks
- 15 Vanity Clothing

Personally, I think this mod is directed towards those new to mods, as it doesn't add too much content, nor too little. Also I REALLY eyeballed all the stats I added to the game, so something may be broken .-.

Probably my first and last mod, it was an experience, Ima just some of my code here just incase of, idk..

You can use anything you want here, idrc, if you haven't already, I recommend joining the Tmodloader discord server, I ctrl+F'd a decent chunk of my code from over there.

Shoutout to Mirsario, his Armor helper helped me make the 15 vanity and 1 armor set, I tried but gave up spriting the long way and oh lordy. THANK YOU Mirsario!

||CODE||

I posted my code for the slightly unique coded items and thoughts here, so if you wanted to know how smt worked, go for it. It slightly explains some stuff too.

||ART||

I used pixilart.com/draw# so uh lol...I don't use art programs / nor do I know how to do art properly, so if you're new I'd recommend that I guess. Remember to set your brush to 2 pixel. I typically shaded with 2 pixels but sometimes I used 1 pixel shading when I didn't have space - Oh yea and about that, I don't know JACK about shading lol, the crappy rule of top right bright, and bottom left dark, is what i followed lol. Most of my sprites were 32 x 32.
